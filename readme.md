## Minutiae Cylinder-Code implementations
---

This repository holds a couple of implementations for the paper [Minutiae Cylinder-Code: A New Representation and Matching Technique for Fingerprint Recognition](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5432197), in C++ and Rust respectively.

The purpose of these implementations is to practice converting paper concepts into actual code and also to experiment a bit with Rust.

Please note that I have not included any external dependencies or build instructions, as these implementations primarily serve as a personal reference for myself.
